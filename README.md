* Automatic Twitter meta-tag generation (can override) ![Twitter SEO Control](https://i.imgur.com/7I4rnXw.png)
    * Also adds a `TwitterAccountName` field to `SilverStripe\Security\Member` which is used for the creator tag. The creator is recorded when a new page is created and their Twitter account name will be used for the meta tag

## Requirements

See [composer.json](composer.json) for details.

## Installation

```bash
composer require quinninteractive/silverstripe-seo
```

## Getting Started

The necessary extensions are automatically applied after installation of this module, and a dev/build.

## Writing Your Own Analysis

Health analyses have been abstracted to give developers the ability to create their own analysis checks.

To do this, you simply need to create a new class that extends `QuinnInteractive\Seo\Analysis\Analysis`.

As an example, let's create a new analysis that checks to see if `Hello World!` is the title of the current page.

First create the following file:

`mysite\code\Analysis\HelloWorldTitleAnalysis.php`

```php
<?php

namespace Vendor\Project\Analysis;

use QuinnInteractive\Seo\Analysis\Analysis;

class HelloWorldTitleAnalysis extends Analysis
{
    const FAILED = 0;
    const SUCCESS = 1;

    public function run()
    {
        if (!strstr($this->getPage()->Title, 'Hello World!')) {
            return static::FAILED;
        }

        return static::SUCCESS;
    }

    public function responses()
    {
        return [
            static::FAILED  => ['The string "Hello World!" does not appear in the page title', 'danger'],
            static::SUCCESS => ['Hoorah!!! "Hello World!" appears in the page title', 'success'],
        ];
    }
}
```

Then dev/build. You will immediately see this new analysis running in the CMS under the "SEO Health Analysis" accordion when editing any page, then change the title to include "Hello World" and you will notice the indicator will display success.

One thing to keep in mind is that the analysis always has access to the `\Page` object that it is running against via `$this->getPage()`, so your responses can also be dynamic.

If you have created an analysis and think it would be beneficial as an addition to this module then we urge you to submit a Pull Request and you will receive full credit for your work. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Explained: `run()`

You must override this method as this is where you will perform all your checks, and then return with an integer respective of the keys you define in `responses()`. It's a good idea to use constants that represent those integers for readability

### Explained: `responses()`

All analyses must override the `responses()` method to provide response messages and the response level (which is used for the indicator).

`run()` should return an integer that matches a key in the array that `responses()` returns, for example if `run()` were to return `1`, then using the above example the message displayed would be `Hoorah!!! "Hello World!" appears in the page title` with an indicator level of `success`

The available indicator levels are: `default`, `danger`, `warning`, `success` which are grey, red, orange and green respectively.

You can optionally prevent certain levels from displaying in the content analysis tab. The following added to the above example would cause it to only display an entry if the indicator level is not of value `success`:

```php
private static $hidden_levels = [
    'success'
];
```

## Configuration Options

### `enable_creator_tag`

By default, this module adds an extension to `\SilverStripe\Security\Member` that adds a single field named `TwitterAccountName`. If this is set, when this particular user creates a page, the `twitter:creator` meta tag will be generated with the Member's account name

You can disable this via YAML:

```yml
QuinnInteractive\Seo\Extensions\PageSeoExtension:
    enable_creator_tag: false
```

### Length of meta description

The module has 2 configuration options pertaining to the length of the meta description. The sample YAML below demonstrates them with their default values. You don't have to make such a file unless you want different values from the defaults.

```yaml
QuinnInteractive\Seo\Analysis\MetaDescAnalysis:
  meta_desc_target_length: 160
  meta_desc_too_long_threshold: 320
```

### Other Options

Other options can be found in the `private static` variables in the following files. They can be overridden in YAML in the usual way.

- PageHealthExtension.php
- PageSeoExtension.php
- SiteConfigSettingsExtension.php

## Assumptions

This module assumes that you make use of the default `Content` field provided by `\Page`. If a specific page does not then you can specify one or multiple fields that contain your content.

They should be ordered in the correct order that they appear for the end user

In your `\Page` subclass you would have:

```php
public function seoContentFields()
{
    return [
        'Content',
        'MyBlock.Title',
        'MyBlock.Content',
        'BottomTitle',
        'BottomContent',
    ];
}
```

In your `\Page` subclass you could add an updateCollateContentFields to provide custom content that is not possible with seoContentFields:

```php
public function updateCollateContentFields($content) {
    // Content is an array of strings with content in the order in which they appear to the user
    $content[] = 'This is example content';
    return $content;
}
```

## Roadmap (subject to change)

* Finish implementing internationalisation to this module and its analyses
* More content analyses
* Given the ability to practically have content coming from anywhere on a SilverStripe page, the `seoContentFields` method was introduced to better improve content analysis by collating all content fields into a single string, this supports dot notation for `has_one` relationships, but may not (or does not) support `has_many` and `many_many` relationships at this time. Ideally moving forward we will want to use the DOM parser (partially implemented) and rely on this instead.
* Finding community support to help improve and better this module for all SilverStripe users
